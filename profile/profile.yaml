    description: Developed a social media style web app for travellers to meet up with other fellow travellers and keep track of their activities during their adventures. Used Agile methodology to ensure sustainable development. Designed wireframes and mockups using Figma to provide a blueprint for the visual elements. Implemented a modern UI for profiles using React, CSS and Bootstrap to ensure responsiveness, consistency and maintainability. Created ERDs using Visual Paradigm for database design. Implemented APIs and middlewares using Node.js and Express to process data exchange between the client and the server. Implemented a Google maps functionality using the Google maps api. Built a CI/CD workflow using Github actions. This was a group capstone project during my studies which allowed me to master and showcase my skills as a full-stack developer, and gain experience in project management while collaborating with others.
  - name: "Firewall Rules API"
    # git_url:
    description: Transformed Powershell scripts in charge of creating, configuring and storing firewall rules into serverless REST APIs using Azure Functions in .Net. The purpose of this project was for improved integration, scalability and maintainability. Implemented authentication using Azure AD to ensure security. Utilized various Azure App-Service APIs to perform CRUD operations. Utilized Entity Framework ORM for improved productivity, and Nunit for testing. This was my main project during my co-op term at MPBSD and it allowed me to hone my skills as a backend developer in a real work environment; it allowed me to learn about fundamental Azure cloud concepts. During this project, I gained real experience with Agile Methodology by participating in sprint plannings, daily scrums, sprint review and retrospective.
